Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime\n\nCustomers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as **casual riders**. And customers who purchase annual memberships are called **members.**\n\n## Business Task\n1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n\n## Overview of the Data Source \nThe data was made available by Motivate International Inc, under the Data license agreement. Motive International Inc, (“Motivate”) operates the city of Chicago Divvy Bicycle sharing service, which the fictional company “Cyclistic” is based on for this case study. More information can be found here: https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement The previous 12 month of bicycle trip data are organized into individual cvs files according to year and month (“202005” = May 2020). Each csv file contains 13 columns including information such as bicycle stations for arrival and departure of bicycles, membership type, and much more concerning location.
